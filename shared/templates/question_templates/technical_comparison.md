# Technical Comparison Template

Use this template when user asks to compare technologies, frameworks, tools, or approaches.

## Template Structure

### TASK
Conduct a technical comparison of [TECHNOLOGY A] vs [TECHNOLOGY B] (and [TECHNOLOGY C]) to evaluate [CRITERIA: performance, features, use cases, trade-offs].

### CONTEXT/BACKGROUND
This comparison will help [AUDIENCE: development team, architects, decision-makers] choose the best technology for [USE CASE: specific project, system architecture, problem domain].

### SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OR SUBTASKS
1. What are the core features and capabilities of each technology?
2. How do they compare in terms of performance (speed, scalability, resource usage)?
3. What are the typical use cases and best-fit scenarios for each?
4. What are the learning curves and developer experience?
5. What is the ecosystem maturity (libraries, tools, community support)?
6. What are the trade-offs and limitations of each approach?
7. What are the real-world adoption patterns and success stories?

### KEYWORDS
- [Tech A] vs [Tech B] comparison
- [Tech A] performance benchmarks
- [Tech B] use cases
- [Tech A] [Tech B] trade-offs

## Example Usage

**User Input**: "Compare WebAssembly and JavaScript for performance"

**Refined Prompt**:

### TASK
Conduct a technical comparison of WebAssembly (Wasm) vs JavaScript to evaluate performance characteristics, use cases, and trade-offs for web application development.

### CONTEXT/BACKGROUND
This comparison will help a web development team decide whether to adopt WebAssembly for performance-critical components of their application.

### SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OR SUBTASKS
1. What are the performance differences in compute-intensive tasks (benchmarks)?
2. How do startup times and memory usage compare?
3. What types of applications benefit most from WebAssembly?
4. What is the developer experience and tooling maturity?
5. How do they interoperate and when should they be used together?
6. What are the browser support and compatibility considerations?
7. What are real-world case studies of WebAssembly adoption?

### KEYWORDS
- WebAssembly vs JavaScript performance
- Wasm benchmark comparison
- WebAssembly use cases
- JavaScript Wasm interop
- WebAssembly browser support
- Wasm performance gains

### CONSTRAINTS
- **Scope**: Web browser environment (not Node.js or server-side)
- **Depth**: Detailed technical analysis with benchmarks
- **Source Quality**: Official specs (A-rated), technical benchmarks (B-rated), developer blogs (C-rated)
- **Recency**: 2022-2024 (WebAssembly evolving rapidly)
- **Report Length**: Detailed (20-25 pages)

### OUTPUT FORMAT
- Comparison matrix: Features, performance, tooling
- Benchmark analysis: Compute, memory, startup time
- Use case guide: When to use Wasm vs JS
- Code examples: Simple Wasm/JS interop
- Decision tree: Selection criteria
