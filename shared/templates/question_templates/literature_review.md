## Example Usage

**User Input**: "Review literature on transformer architectures in AI"

**Refined Prompt**:

### TASK
Conduct a systematic literature review on transformer architectures in artificial intelligence to synthesize key innovations, applications, and research directions from 2017 to present.

2. What are the main architectural innovations (sparse attention, efficient transformers, etc.)?
3. What applications have transformers been successfully applied to (NLP, vision, multimodal)?
4. What are the key performance benchmarks and comparisons?
5. What are the identified limitations (computational cost, long-range dependencies, etc.)?
6. What are the emerging research directions (efficient transformers, interpretability, etc.)?
7. How has the field evolved from 2017 to 2024?

### KEYWORDS
