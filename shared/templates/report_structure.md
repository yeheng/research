# Research Report Structure Templates

> **Template Type**: Reference Documentation
>
> **Purpose**: This document provides structural templates for different types of research reports.
>
> **Usage**: These templates are **reference guides** for human researchers and agents. They are NOT programmatically enforced. Agents should follow these structures when generating reports, but the templates serve as guidelines rather than strict validation rules.
